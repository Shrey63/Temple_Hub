All 12 Mahadev Jyotirlingas at one place
                This project is developed in order to digitize the Abhishieks which are carried out at scared Temples of lord SHIVA. The system allows the general people living far away from these places to register for puja/havan without reaching there physically. They just need to register/SignUp themselves to the system by inputting the basic credentials. After that the individual is verified by the system during login, Once the individual is verified the user is able to login to the system using login credentials as per registration and then he/she is eligible for havan at any of 12 jyotirlinga of Shiva. The systemâ€™s database has all control of the previous havan donation etc. done by user. The user after filling form can go for payment by scanning the QR Code provided. All the stuff is dynamic from the database.Our details are also provided in About us section with a feedback form.
